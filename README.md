# SurveyPortal
The SurveyPortal is a web application built using ASP.NET MVC and SQL Server. It allows users to participate in surveys, with functionality to manage questions and responses. Admin users are granted special authorization to add, edit, and manage surveys, ensuring that only authorized personnel can modify survey content.

The portal also incorporates Chart.js to display visual data analytics, helping admins to easily interpret survey results with interactive charts and graphs. This feature provides insights into user responses, making it easier to assess the collected data.
Key Features:

Admin Authorization: Admin users have the ability to create, edit, and delete surveys and questions. They can also manage responses and track user participation.

Survey Participation: Employees can log in, view survey questions, select options, and submit their responses.

Data Management: Admins have access to detailed user response data, including the ability to generate summaries of responses, total marks, and user performance.

Security: The portal ensures secure access and is designed with user authentication and role-based authorization for admins and employees.
